#  Yankees take down Angels for seventh straight win

Chase Headley singled in the tie-breaking run in the seventh inning, and the New York Yankees extended their winning streak to seven games with a 3-2 victory over the Los Angeles Angels on Tuesday night.

Luis Severino pitched six innings of two-hit ball and striking out nine, but the Angels tied it at 2 in the sixth on Andrelton Simmons' sacrifice fly. Dellin Betances (2-0) got two outs in the seventh and Aroldis Chapman closed it out for his ninth save.

Headley's single came off Cam Bedrosian (1-1) with one out after Gary Sanchez walked and took third on Headley's double down the left-field line.

The Yankees have won seven straight for the first time since winning eight in a row from Aug. 26 to Sept. 3, 2016. They are 8-1 this season against their AL West rivals.

#  Tanaka dominant once again as Yankees continue to roll

Masahiro Tanaka was electric once again on Sunday, as the Yankees cruised to their fourth consecutive victory. Tanaka was dominant, striking out 10 batters while allowing just two runs in 7 innings of work.

Gleyber Torres continued his impressive rookie season with two more hits, including a home run. Torres now has 9 homers and 29 RBIs on the season. He has been a major bright spot for the Yankees, who have struggled at times this year.

The bullpen continues to be a strength for the Yankees, with Zach Britton, David Robertson and Aroldis Chapman all pitching well recently. They will need that bullpen to continue to pitch well as they make their push towards the playoffs.

The Yankees are now just 1 game behind the Boston Red Sox in the AL East and hold a 2-game lead over the Oakland Athletics for the first wild card spot. They have been playing very well lately and appear to be hitting their stride as the postseason approaches.

#  Judge continues historic rookie season with another home run

In a game against the division leading Brewers, Judge continued his historic rookie season with another home run. It was his 44th of the season, tying him for most in a single season by a rookie with Wally Berger and Mark McGwire.

Judge is also now one of only six players in history to hit at least 40 home runs in their first season. The others are Babe Ruth, Ted Williams, Mickey Mantle, Jose Canseco, and Alex Rodriguez.

Judge's home run helped lift the Yankees to a 4-3 victory over the Brewers and improved their record to 82-51 on the season. They remain in first place in the American League East, 7 1/2 games ahead of the second place Red Sox.

#  Yankees clinch AL East division title!

In what might have been their most important win of the season, the Yankees clinched the AL East division title on Thursday night.

The game started off poorly for the Yankees, as they gave up three runs in the first inning. But they battled back, scoring six unanswered runs to take the lead and eventually win 7-3.

It was a much-needed win for the Yankees, who had lost their previous two games and four of their last six.

"We've had our ups and downs this season, but we never stopped fighting," said Yankee outfielder Brett Gardner. "And now we're division champions."

The Yankees will now turn their attention to the playoffs. They will face off against the Oakland Athletics in the best-of-five ALDS beginning on Friday night.

#  New York heads to the playoffs with big win over Red Sox

The New York Yankees clinched their spot in the playoffs with an impressive 10-2 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Tuesday night. A three-run homer by rookie Miguel Andujar and a grand slam by Gary Sanchez highlighted the Yankeesâ€™ offensive attack.

New York starter Luis Severino pitched six innings, allowing just two runs on four hits while striking out nine. The bullpen took care of the rest, with David Robertson, Zach Britton, and Aroldis Chapman all pitching a scoreless inning to close out the game.

For the Red Sox, it was a rough night at the plate. Jackie Bradley Jr. and Mookie Betts were the only players able to get multiple hits off of Severino, and the team as a whole went just 3-for-25 with runners in scoring position.

Boston starter Nathan Eovaldi had an uncharacteristically bad outing, lasting just three innings and giving up six runs on eight hits.

The Yankees now enter into a three-game series against the Orioles starting Wednesday night, with their sights set on clinching first place in the American League East.
