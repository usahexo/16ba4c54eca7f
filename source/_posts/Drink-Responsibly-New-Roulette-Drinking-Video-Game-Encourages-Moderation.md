#  Could Roulette Drinking Game be the Next Big Thing in Social Gambling?

When people think about gambling, the first thing that likely comes to mind is the classic casino game of roulette. Roulette has been around for centuries and is known for being one of the most exciting and suspenseful games in the casino. Now, a new drinking game that is based on roulette is gaining popularity, could this be the next big thing in social gambling?

The game of roulette is simple. Players place their bets on either black or red, odd or even, or a number from 1 to 36. Then, a ball is spun around a wheel and players must guess where it will end up. If they guess correctly, they win!

The new drinking game that is based on roulette is called ‘Roulette Drinks’. The game is played with a regular deck of playing cards. Each player is dealt one card and the aim of the game is to drink when your card matches the number that comes up on the roulette wheel. For example, if you are dealt an Ace of Spades and the number drawn on the roulette wheel is 4, then you would drink 4 shots.

Roulette Drinks can be played with any number of players, making it perfect for parties and social gatherings. The game can also be modified to make it more or less challenging, depending on your preference. For example, you could make it so that players only have to drink if their card matches the number that is actually called out on the roulette wheel, rather than simply matching the number that appears on the table. This would make the game more challenging and increase the amount of alcohol consumed!

If you’re looking for a fun new way to gamble and drink with friends, then Roulette Drinks is definitely worth checking out!

#  Drink And Gamble Responsibly With This New Roulette Drinking Game

A fun new drinking game for parties is Roulette drinking. You will need a large cup for each player, a few different types of alcohol, and a die.

Players sit around a table or in a circle and take turns rolling the die. Whoever rolls the highest number starts. That player takes a drink and then rolls the die again. Whatever number comes up is how many spaces they move their cup around the table. If they land on another player’s cup, that player drinks and then it is their turn to roll the die. If you roll a six, you get to move your cup back to the starting point and everyone else moves ahead one space.

The game is over when someone either reaches the finish or falls over drunk.
