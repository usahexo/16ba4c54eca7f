#  Smart bettors are capitalizing on sports gambling's resurgence

It's been nearly a decade since the United States Supreme Court struck down a federal law banning sports betting, and bettors are finally starting to take advantage of the renaissance. In the aftermath of the decision, many states have jumped on the bandwagon, legalizing some form of sports gambling.

For those willing to do their homework, this offers opportunities to make money by betting sensibly. The first step is understanding the landscape – which states have legalized sports gambling, and what types of bets are available?

The second step is studying the teams and players involved in each matchup. This involves analyzing things like recent performance, injuries, and home-field advantage.

The third step is developing a sound betting strategy. Some bettors prefer to simply pick the team they think will win, while others try to find value in prop bets or against-the-spread wagers. Whichever route you choose, be sure to stay disciplined and only bet what you can afford to lose.

 Legalized sports gambling is still in its infancy, so there's plenty of opportunity for shrewd bettors to make money. By following the tips above, you can put yourself in a position to capitalize on this exciting trend.

#  Nevada sports books facing unprecedented losses from gambler 'aboutfaces'

LAS VEGAS -- In the days leading up to the Nevada caucuses, sports books across the state were filled with anxious bettors looking to make a killing on the election. But as it turned out, many of those same bettors wound up losing big when their preferred candidates lost.

"We had a lot of people who came in and put money on Marco Rubio or Jeb Bush, and when they dropped out, they had to basically give all their money back," said Jay Kornegay, vice president of race and sports operations at the Las Vegas Hilton.

Kornegay said that overall, bookmakers around the state lost millions of dollars as a result of the election. "It was easily one of our worst years ever," he said.

While it's impossible to know for certain who was responsible for so much financial carnage, industry insiders say there is little doubt that much of it can be traced back to last-minute gambler "aboutfaces."

"A lot of these guys were hedging their bets by betting on multiple candidates, and then when their preferred candidate dropped out, they would switch their bets to the other side," said TonyDiNitto, an editor at SportsBusiness Daily who has written extensively about Nevada sports books. "That caused a lot of big losses for the books."

To make matters worse, many bettors also took advantage of Nevada's liberal betting rules to place large wagers well after odds had been set. This led to even more significant losses for the sports books when their chosen candidates inevitably lost.

"We had some people who placed $100,000 bets on Donald Trump in the final hours before the election," said Kornegay. "If he would have won, they would have made a fortune, but obviously that didn't happen."

#  Sports gamblers turning their fortunes around with savvy bets

A growing number of sports gamblers are turning to data analytics to improve their chances of winning. By studying trends and making informed bets, these savvy bettors are often able to beat the odds and turn a profit.

One such gambler is John, who has been betting on sports for years. He has found that by looking at things like point spreads and home field advantage, he can make more accurate predictions about which games will be close calls. This season, he has already turned a small profit thanks to his smart bets.

Similarly, Sarah has had great success using data analytics to handicap horse races. By studying the form of different horses and looking at things like recent race results, she is often able to spot good bets that other people may not have noticed. This Sunday, she plans to put her knowledge to the test by betting on a few longshots at the racetrack.

While some people may view sports gambling as a risky proposition, those who use data analytics know that it can be a profitable venture. So if you're looking for a way to make some extra money this season, consider giving data-driven sports betting a try.

#  Bookies losing ground as public jumps on hot sports gambling trend

Las Vegas might be the gambling capital of the world, but it’s not the only place where people can bet on sports. In recent years, there has been a trend towards legal sports betting in many parts of the United States, as well as in other countries. This is bad news for bookmakers, who are seeing their business suffer as a result.

One reason for this trend is the fact that it’s now easier than ever to place a bet on sports. There are numerous online and mobile gambling platforms that allow customers to bet on games from anywhere in the world. In addition, many of these platforms offer competitive odds and a wide variety of betting options.

Another reason for the increasing popularity of sports betting is the legalization of gambling in some states. This has created a more favorable environment for bookmakers, who can now operate without fear of prosecution. It has also led to an increase in advertising and promotion of sports gambling, which has helped to attract new customers.

Despite the growth in sports betting, bookmakers still have an advantage over gamblers. This is because they have access to detailed information about each game, including team stats and player injuries. They also have extensive knowledge about different betting strategies and how to place effective bets.

As a result, bookmakers are still making money from sports gambling – although their profits are declining as more people get into the game. It will be interesting to see how this trend develops over time, and whether or not bookmakers can find a way to stay ahead of the curve.

#  More Americans betting on sports as legal landscape changes

Americans have been betting on sports for centuries, and the practice is as popular as ever - even as the legal landscape surrounding it changes.

The Supreme Court's recent decision to overturn a federal law that effectively criminalized sports betting outside of Nevada has led to a flurry of activity in state legislatures around the country, as lawmakers debate how to best regulate and tax this newly-legal industry.

In some states, such as New Jersey, lawmakers are moving quickly to pass legislation that would allow casinos and other sporting venues to offer sports betting. Other states, such as Delaware and West Virginia, have already legalized sports gambling in anticipation of the Supreme Court's ruling.

Legal experts expect most states will eventually legalize some form of sports betting in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision. This will create a growing market for sports betting services, which are currently enjoyed by millions of Americans through illegal bookmakers and offshore websites.

With the eventual legalization of sports betting across much of the country, more Americans are likely to start placing bets on their favorite teams. This could lead to increased interest in professional and collegiate athletics, as well as more money being wagered on games.

It remains to be seen how the legalization of sports betting will change the American sporting landscape, but one thing is clear: fans everywhere will be keeping a close eye on the action on the field - and off it too.
