#  When Will New York State Fully Legalize Sports Betting? 

The landscape of the betting industry is constantly in flux, as new technologies and sports leagues emerge. Nevertheless, there are a few questions that remain pertinent to the future of this industry. One of these questions is when will New York State fully legalize sports betting?

This is an important question because the New York gambling market is one of the most lucrative in the United States. If New York were to legalize sports betting, it would provide a major boost to the industry as a whole.

At present, only a handful of states have fully legalized sports betting. These states are Nevada, Delaware, Oregon, and Montana. In most other states, sports betting is only legal in certain forms. For example, in Pennsylvania sports betting is only legal through online platforms operated by the state lottery.

There are a few reasons why New York has been slow to fully legalize sports betting. The first reason is that there has been some hesitance on the part of lawmakers to introduce new legislation. This is largely due to the fact that there are already many forms of gambling available in New York, and lawmakers are not eager to add yet another form of gambling to the mix.

A second reason for the delay in legalizing sports betting is that there is some concern about how such a move would impact the traditional casino industry in New York. Casino operators are worried that if sports betting were legalized, people would spend less money at their establishments.

So far, none of these concerns have managed to block progress on legalizing sports betting in New York State. In May 2018, a bill that would legalize sports betting was introduced in the state legislature. This bill has since passed through several committees and could be voted on by the full legislature later this year.

If this bill passes, it will mark a significant milestone for the gambling industry in New York State. With so many other states having already legalized sports betting, it is only a matter of time before New York follows suit.

#  NY Provides Update on Sports Betting Legalization 

New York regulators released an update on their progress in legalizing sports betting on Thursday.

According to the report, the New York Gaming Commission and the New York State Thoroughbred Horsemen’s Association have been working together to develop regulations for wagering on horses. The groups have also been meeting with other stakeholders to get their input on the plans.

In terms of sports betting, the commission is currently working on a licensing process for both casinos and racetracks. The goal is to have everything ready by fall so that sports betting can commence in time for the start of the NFL season.

It’s been a little more than a year since the US Supreme Court ruled in favor of New Jersey’s challenge to the federal ban on sports betting. That decision allowed states to legalize sports betting if they chose to do so.

Since then, several states have moved forward with legalization, including Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Both Nevada and Delaware already had some form of legalized sports betting prior to the Supreme Court ruling.

New York had initially hoped to legalize sports betting before the end of 2018, but it now looks like that won’t be happening. Still, there’s optimism that things will move quickly now that regulators have a better idea of what needs to be done.

#  WHEN WILL WE SEE LEGAL SPORTS BETTING IN NEW YORK STATE?! 

There is a lot of speculation about when New York will legalize sports betting. After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal ban in May, it’s up to each state to decide if they want to allow sports betting within their borders. Many believe that New York will legalize it sooner rather than later because it is a big money maker. In 2016, the Nevada gaming industry pulled in $4.9 billion from sports betting, while Delaware brought in $3 million and Montana saw just $200,000 in total profits.

As of right now, there are no concrete plans to legalize sports betting in New York State, but lawmakers are definitely considering it. There are a few different bills that are being discussed, including one that would create a new Gaming Commission specifically for sports betting. The commission would be responsible for regulating and licensing casinos as well as issuing permits for sports betting operations.

 Another bill would allow existing casinos in the state to offer sports betting, but there would be a 10 percent tax on all bets placed. This bill has already passed the Assembly and is currently being considered by the Senate. Governor Cuomo has said that he supports legalizing sports betting but wants to make sure that there are strong consumer protections in place first.

So what are the odds of New York legalizing sports betting in 2018? It’s hard to say at this point, but most experts believe it will happen sooner rather than later. There is already a lot of interest from casino operators and consumers alike, so it seems like only a matter of time before something is finalized. Keep an eye on this space – we’ll keep you posted!

#  Timeline for sports betting legalization released in New York 

New York State officials released a comprehensive timeline for the legalization of sports betting within the state. The document offers a rough schedule for when various aspects of the new legislation will be implemented, from the appointment of an advisory board to the start of operations. 

According to the timeline, the New York Gaming Commission (NYGC) will appoint an advisory board by September 1, 2019. This group will be responsible for drafting regulations governing sports betting, which must then be approved by the NYGC. Once finalized, these regulations will be made public and businesses will be able to apply for licenses to offer sports betting. Operators will then have 90 days to begin offering bets. 

The timeline also includes a number of milestones that must be met before sports betting can commence. These include: 

- The development and implementation of a monitoring system that can detect unusual betting patterns
- The registration and approval of data providers 
- The establishment of procedures to address problem gambling 
- And the adoption of rules regarding marketing and advertising

While it’s still early days, this provides some clarity on when New Yorkers can expect to start gambling on sports.

#  New York releases plan to legalize sports betting

On Monday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced a proposal to legalize sports betting in the state. The bill would allow for both in-person and online sports betting, with the latter option being available only to New Yorkers who are 21 or older.

The proposal is part of a larger gambling expansion package that Cuomo is pushing this year. Other components of the package include adding new casinos and legalizing online poker and casino games.

According to Cuomo, the proposed sports betting legislation would allow New York to capture some of the $150 billion that is wagered on sports illegally each year. He estimates that legalizing sports betting could generate up to $500 million in annual revenue for the state.

Opposition to the gambling expansion package is already mounting, with critics arguing that it will lead to increased addiction and social ills. But Cuomo is undeterred, saying that “There are people who want to do things that are bad for them and we can’t stop them. We have an obligation to protect the people who can’t protect themselves.”

Assuming the bill passes into law, New York would become the second US state (after Delaware) to offer both online and in-person sports betting.
