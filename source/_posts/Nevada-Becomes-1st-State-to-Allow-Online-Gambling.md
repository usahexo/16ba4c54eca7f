#  Nevada Becomes 1st State to Allow Online Gambling

Nevada has become the first U.S. state to allow online gambling, after Governor Brian Sandoval signed a bill into law on Tuesday that legalizes the practice.

Under the new law, Nevadans will be able to gamble online on poker and other casino games, as long as they are physically located in the state. The legislation also allows for Nevada's casinos to partner with out-of-state companies to offer online gambling services.

"This is an important day for the people of Nevada," Governor Sandoval said in a statement. "The signing of this bill marks a major step forward in our efforts to attract new business and create jobs in the Silver State."

The new law is expected to create thousands of new jobs in Nevada's gaming and technology industries, and is expected to generate millions of dollars in tax revenue for the state.

#  NJ Governor Christie Signs Online Gambling Bill Into Law

On February 26, 2013, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie signed into law a bill legalizing online gambling in the state. The new law will allow Atlantic City casinos to offer online poker, casino games and slots to players located within New Jersey.

In a statement released after he signed the bill, Governor Christie said, "This is another step in the right direction to revive Atlantic City and make it a world-class resort destination. This new industry will create thousands of jobs and generate tens of millions of dollars in tax revenue."

The commercial casino industry in New Jersey has been struggling in recent years, with five of the 12 casinos closing their doors since 2011. Supporters of online gambling believe that the new law will help to revive the casino industry in the state.

Opponents of online gambling argue that it could lead to addiction and other negative consequences. However, Governor Christie said that he is confident that New Jersey's gaming regulators will put in place strong controls to protect consumers.

Under the new law, only registeredAtlantic City casino operators will be allowed to offer online gambling services. Players must be at least 21 years old and located within New Jersey in order to participate.

The first Atlantic City casinos are expected to begin offering online gambling services later this year.

#  Delaware Takes Its Step Toward Legalizing Online Gambling

_The state of Delaware is making moves to legalize online gambling._

This week, the Delaware House of Representatives passed a bill that would legalize and regulate online gambling within the state. The bill, which passed by a vote of 25-3, now heads to the Senate for consideration.

Under the proposed bill, online gambling would be legalized for residents 21 and older. Online casinos and poker sites would be authorized to operate in the state, and would be regulated by the Delaware Division of Gaming Enforcement.

Delaware is not the first state to consider legalizing online gambling. In fact, several states have already moved forward with legalization plans. Nevada and New Jersey both have regulated online gambling markets, while other states, such as California and Illinois, are in the process of considering similar measures.

Supporters of online gambling say that it will bring much-needed revenue to states struggling with budget deficits. Opponents argue that it could lead to increased addiction and social problems.

What do you think? Should online gambling be legalized?

#  California Likely to Legalize Online Poker This Year

California is on the verge of becoming the fifth U.S. state to legalize online poker.

The proposed legislation, SB 888, was introduced in February by State Senator Isadore Hall III and has already passed the Senate by a unanimous vote. The bill is now pending in the Assembly, where it is expected to pass as well.

Once the bill becomes law, Californians will be able to play poker online at licensed and regulated websites. Players will be required to be at least 21 years of age and will need to establish an account with a licensed site.

The legislation will also create a new type of license for operators who wish to offer online poker. This includes a $5 million licensing fee and a requirement that operators have physical premises in California.

The chances of the bill passing are good, as it has broad bipartisan support. It also has the backing of major gaming interests in the state, including Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts International.

If SB 888 does become law, California will join Nevada, New Jersey, Delaware, and Pennsylvania in legalizing online poker. This would give U.S. players access to some of the best online poker sites in the world.
