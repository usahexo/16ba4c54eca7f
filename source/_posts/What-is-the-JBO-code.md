#  What is the JBO code?

The JBO (Java Business Objects) code is a library that allows developers to create Java applications that interface with Enterprise Information Systems (EIS). It was created by JBoss, now part of Red Hat. The code provides a way for Java developers to access and manipulate data in a variety of formats, including XML, JSON, and HTML.

The JBO code is open source, and is released under the LGPL license. It is widely used in commercial applications, and is included in the JBoss application server. The code has been ported to a number of languages, including C#, Ruby on Rails, and PHP.

The JBO code can be downloaded at https://github.com/jboss-jbo/jbo.
