#  George Walker Bush Wins Presidential Election - Becomes 43rd U.S. President

In a stunning election upset, Texas Governor George W. Bush is elected the 43rd president of the United States, narrowly defeating Vice President Al Gore despite losing the popular vote.

Bush's victory comes after one of the most contentious and disputed elections in American history, with the results coming down to Florida's 25 electoral votes. After a month-long standoff between Republicans and Democrats over the fate of hundreds of disputed ballots in Palm Beach County, a 5-4 U.S. Supreme Court decision ends the recount, essentially giving Florida's electoral votes to Bush.

Bush takes office on January 20, 2001, pledging to unite a nation deeply divided over the outcome of the election.

#  George Walker Bush Inaugurated as 43rd President of the United States

On January 20, 2001, in front of the Capitol and under a cold, slate sky, George Walker Bush was sworn in as the 43rd president of the United States.

Bush took the oath of office administered by Chief Justice William Rehnquist. His wife, Laura, and their two daughters, Jenna and Barbara, held the Bible on which he swore his oath. The inauguration ceremony took place 8 months and 10 days after a bitterly contested election that was ultimately decided by 537 votes out of nearly 6 million cast in Florida.

In his inaugural address, Bush spoke of the challenges ahead. "We are engaged in a great war against terror," he said. "And we will not rest until this war is won." He also pledged to restore civility to Washington politics and to be a president for all Americans.

The formal proceedings of Inauguration Day were followed by an elaborate parade down Pennsylvania Avenue. More than 8,000 participants marched or rode their floats past the cheering crowds lining the street. The parade included representatives of more than 100 countries and featured such staples as marching bands and military units as well as floats portraying various aspects of American life.

#  George Walker Bush Addresses Congress on First Day of His Presidency

President George Walker Bush addressed a joint session of Congress on his first day in office. He spoke of the "era of limits" and outlined his plan to reduce the size of government, empower individuals and families, and revive the economy.

"The people have spoken and now it is time for government to listen," said Bush. "Our citizens are looking for leadership that recognizes we are living in an era of limits, an era where big government is not the answer to every problem. They want us to reduce the size and cost of government, so we can empower individuals and families."

Bush called for a new era of personal responsibility in which all Americans take ownership of their own lives and futures. "In order for our economy to grow, we must have a society based on personal responsibility," he said. "Responsibility starts with each individual; it starts with parents taking responsibility for their children, workers taking responsibility for their jobs, and citizens taking responsibility for their communities."

Bush also pledged to revive America's economy by cutting taxes, promoting free trade, reducing regulations, and restraining federal spending. "We will put our economy on the path to growth by giving our people more money in their pockets," he said. "We will revive our spirit by freeing America from the grip of big government."

#  George Walker Bush Signs Legislation Extending Tax Cuts

President George Walker Bush signs the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, extending tax cuts for all taxpayers.

“This legislation provides tax relief to families across America, gives our economy the boost it needs, and strengthens our Nation’s fiscal foundation,” the President said.

The bill, passed by Congress earlier in the day, extends income tax cuts enacted under President Ronald Reagan in 1981 and 1986. President Bush had called for the extension in his 2001 State of the Union address.

Under the new law, all taxpayers will receive a reduction in their individual income tax rates. The lowest rate will be reduced from 15 percent to 10 percent, and the highest rate will be reduced from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. Standard deductions and personal exemptions will also be increased.

The bill also accelerates a portion of the original tax relief package that was set to take effect in 2006 or 2007. This change will allow most taxpayers to keep more of their paychecks starting this year. Married couples with incomes of less than $40,000 will see an average tax cut of more than $1,000.

“Today’s action is another important step on the road to economic recovery and greater prosperity for all Americans,” the President said.

#  George Walker Bush Visits Casino and Wins in Roulette

Former President George W. Bush made an unannounced visit to a Las Vegas casino over the weekend, and won big at the roulette wheel.

According to employees at the casino, Bush arrived around 9:00 PM on Saturday night, and proceeded to play roulette for several hours. He reportedly wagered a total of $2,000 on the game, and managed to win over $6,000.

Bush was apparently in a good mood after his win, and posed for photos with several casino employees. He also shook hands with some of the gamblers who were unlucky enough to be playing at the same table as him.

When asked about his visit to the casino, Bush said that he "had a lot of fun" and that "the Lord was good to me." He added that he plans to return to Las Vegas in the future, and may even try his hand at blackjack or poker.
