Aquila Basket Trento [4-4] vs Cavallari [8-0]

This Wednesday, Aquila Basket Trento takes on league-leading Cavallari in a matchup that is sure to excite fans. Aquila Basket Trento has had an up-and-down season so far, while Cavallari has been undefeated thus far. This game is definitely a David vs Goliath matchup, but anything can happen in basketball.

Aquila Basket Trento will need to play at their best if they want to upset Cavallari. They will need to shoot well from beyond the arc, and they will need to rebound effectively. If they can do these things, they have a chance of winning this game. However, Cavallari is a very talented team, and they are not likely to be easy to beat.

It should be an exciting game to watch, and it will be interesting to see how Aquila Basket Trento fares against the top team in the league.

#  Aquila Basket Trento looks to chalk up another victory against bottom-dwellers Pesaro

Aquila Basket Trento is looking to chalk up another victory when they face bottom-dwellers Pesaro on Thursday. The game is scheduled to tip off at 7:00 PM local time at PalaDozza in Bologna, Italy.

Trento (10 wins) currently occupies third place in the standings, while Pesaro (3 wins) is in last place. The home team is a heavy favorite to win and cover the point spread.

In their previous matchup on January 2nd, Aquila Basket Trento defeated Pesaro 97-77. Forward David Moss led all scorers with 24 points on 8-for-14 shooting, while center Marco Cusin chipped in 18 points and seven rebounds. For Pesaro, guard Stefano Spizzichini led the way with 20 points on 8-for-13 shooting.

The teams have met twice this season, and Trento has won both games by an average of 21 points.

It will be interesting to see if Trento can maintain its dominance against a weaker opponent or if Pesaro can put up a fight and keep the game close.

#  Second-place Chieti falls to Aquila Basket Trento; noteworthy upset or chalk?

The Aquila Basket Trento team was able to pull off an upset victory against the second-ranked Chieti team. However, this may not be considered much of an upset as Chieti has been struggling as of late.

The Aquila Basket Trento squad put on an impressive performance, shooting nearly 50% from the field and knocking down nine three pointers. Their hot shooting was too much for the Chieti squad to overcome.

The Aquila Basket Trento players were led by Federico Mussini who scored 20 points on the night. Other contributors for the squad included Tommaso Ingrosso and Michele Vitali who each scored 13 points.

For the Chieti squad, Nikola Milutinov led the way with 18 points and 10 rebounds. Other contributors for the team included Alessandro Amici and Jacopo Giachetti who each scored 14 points.

This victory by Aquila Basket Trento is a nice win, but it is not likely to shake up the standings too much as Chieti has been playing poorly as of late.

#  An upset in the making? Aquila Basket Trento set to topple mighty Roma

Aquila Basket Trento are in the relegation zone of the Italian Basketball League (Lega Basket Serie A), but they are set to topple mighty Roma, who are perched comfortably in 4th place.

Roma have had a relatively good season so far, but they will be up against an Aquila side that is desperate for points. The home team will be looking to Captain Diego Flaccadori and American forward Kenny Gabriel to lead them to victory.

Gabriel has averaged 15 points and 6 rebounds per game this season, whilst Flaccadori has chipped in with 14 points on average. They will need to be at their best against a strong Roma outfit that is spearheaded by Serbian guard Nenad Krstic.

Krstic has averaged over 20 points per game this season and he will be looking to continue his good form against Aquila. He will be supported by Croatian forward Ante Tomic, who is averaging almost 16 points per game this season.

The two teams have already met twice this season, with both games resulting in victory for Roma. However, Aquila will be looking to cause an upset at home, where they have won all but one of their games this season.

#  Can Aquila Basket Trento continue their hot streak and make some noise in the playoffs?

In the Italian basketball league, Aquila Basket Trento is having a heck of a season. They are currently in first place with a record of 25-5 and they show no signs of slowing down. Their success can be attributed to several factors, including their top-tier players and their great coach.

Even though they are the top team in the league, Aquila will not be taken lightly by their opponents in the playoffs. Fortitudo Bologna, their likely opponent in the semifinals, is a very good team that poses a serious threat. However, Aquila have proven that they can compete with anyone and I believe they have what it takes to make a deep run in the playoffs.

The key for Aquila will be to continue playing as a team and not rely on any one player to carry them to victory. They have shown that they can win games even when their superstar players are having an off night. This type of teamwork will be essential against tougher opponents in the playoffs.

If Aquila can stay focused and play up to their potential, I believe they can make some serious noise in the playoffs and possibly win the whole thing. They are definitely one of the teams to watch in this yearâ€™s tournament!
